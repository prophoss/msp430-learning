# msp430-learning
Working through each peripheral in a specific way.  

The idea is to work through each peripheral in a specific way so as to learn 
how to use each part of the MCU. 
# GPIO and Timers
1.Loop driven blilnky  
2.Polled GPIO: blink LED with a button push  
3.Interupt driven blinky  
4.Timer driven blinky on interupt  
5.Timer driven with change on button push  

Now we can discuss how do actually creae each one of these. 
###Loop driven blinky  
This is a program that toggles the LED off and on at a set interval. Say every second.
